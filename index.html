				<p>You are a cis white male making decisions for him and his family. Make sure to trust the right sources so that you all stay happy and healthy. Your goal is to survive the pandemic. Every month, you will recieve news and have a decision to make for your family. Multiple news sources are provided, and any may be cancelled, with virtually no impact.</p>
